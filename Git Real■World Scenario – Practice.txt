                                                                                  Git Real■World Scenario – Practice Notes
1. Initialize Repository
mkdir devops_practice
cd devops_practice
git init
echo Hello DevOps > index.txt
git add index.txt
git commit -m "first"
2. Branch Creation and Work
git branch dev
git checkout dev
echo New line>>index.txt
git add .
git commit -m "new"
3. Merge to Master
git checkout master
git merge dev
4. Connect to GitHub Remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourrepo.git
git push -u origin master
5. Common Error – Non Fast Forward
Error occurs when remote has commits that local does not have.
Solution:
git pull origin master --rebase --allow-unrelated-histories
6. Merge Conflict Resolution
Open conflicted file
Remove <<<<<< ===== >>>>>> markers
git add index.txt
git rebase --continue
7. Final Push
git push -u origin master
Key Learning Points
1 Always pull before push
2 Avoid nested git repositories
3 Use rebase to keep history clean



2)

Is this level og it knowledge is enough or anything more to know 
if yes give context or let move to github acions

Good question — and I’ll answer honestly like a mentor, not to just motivate you.

👉 Short Truth

This Git level is enough for a junior DevOps interview.

You already covered:

✅ clone / init / commit / push
✅ branch workflow
✅ merge vs rebase
✅ real conflict resolution
✅ non–fast-forward scenario
✅ remote integration

👉 This is exactly what 70% of DevOps freshers DON’T know practically.

🧠 But Interviewer Will Expect 3 MORE Git Concepts

Before moving to GitHub Actions, you must know these verbally:

1) Git Workflow Concept

You should be able to say:

“In our project we follow feature-branch workflow.
Devs create branch → raise PR → code review → merge to main → pipeline triggers.”

Commands to remember:

git checkout -b feature/login
git push origin feature/login

2) Reset vs Revert vs Rebase (Very Important)

Reset – delete history (local mostly)

git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1


Revert – safe in production

git revert <commit-id>


Rebase – clean history

git rebase master


👉 Interview line:

Reset rewrites history – dangerous in shared branch.
Revert creates new commit – safe for production.

3) .gitignore & Best Practices

You must tell:

❌ Don’t push:

node_modules

.env

passwords

build files

Example:

node_modules/
.env
*.log
